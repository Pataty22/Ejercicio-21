            Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of
            the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of
            a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet,
            in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center
            â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth,
            if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not
            in theory. Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be
            used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from
            science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come
            from science. What was most significant about the lunar voyage was
            not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the
            earth. A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl
            who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her
            violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I
            could not help but love and cherish her.
